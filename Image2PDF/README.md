# Image2PDF

My mom asks me to help her to convert a bunch of images to a single PDF file from time to time.
I'm tired of doing it manually, so I wrote this script to automate the process.

To use this script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as package `img2pdf`.
The GUI is built with `tkinter`, which is included in the standard library of Python 3.
You may install via pip:
```bash
pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple img2pdf
```
